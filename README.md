# Primitive V1 Subgraph

Primitive is a decentralized protocol for options that is focused on security and simplicity. Users and developers will tap into the protocol to offer and underwrite tokenized options on any ERC-20 token. The protocol operates without any centralized control, enabling an immutable set of smart contracts to work in perpetuity on Ethereum.
